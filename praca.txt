  Reacently I went on a trip to Warsaw. I was there for 2 weeks, and I'd like to share my expeariance. 
  Warsaw has a few landmarks that in my opinion are really worth visiting. Some of them are "Palac kultury", "Centrum Nauki Kopernik", a few museums and more. The local food was also really good. If you do decide to go there, I'd recommend trying "pierogi".
  Overall I really enjoyed Warsaw. The locals are really kind, the architecture looks really good and the temperature is nice. I'd really recommend seeing it for yourself.
